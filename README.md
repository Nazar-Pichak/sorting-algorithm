# unittest

An interesting task from training platphorm for developers CodeWars.
The sorting algorithm and function I have created myself.
To ensure it works properly I have implemented some unittest for this function,
utilizing buitl-in framework [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).
