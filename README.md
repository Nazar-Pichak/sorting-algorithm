# unittest for sorting function

An interesting task from training platform for developers [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard).
The sorting algorithm and function I have created by myself.
To ensure it works properly I have implemented some unittest for this function,
utilizing built-in framework [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html).
